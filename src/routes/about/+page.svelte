                Hey, my name is Felix Zhao, and I'm a programmer with a passion for gaming, science, 
                math, and athletics. I love swimming because it keeps me physically fit and mentally sharp, 
                and I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself both in all aspects of my life.<br><br>
        
                As a programmer, I'm always learning new things. I've got a solid foundation in programming 
                languages like Python and C++, and I've also learned JavaScript and SvelteKit for my portfolio. 
                Speaking of which, I'm always working on exciting new software projects, like bots that can help 
                me automate games or automatic YouTube video generators. I'm always pushing myself to learn more 
                and explore new ideas in the world of software development.<br><br>
        
                If you're curious about SvelteKit, it's a framework for building web applications using Svelte, 
                a modern and efficient JavaScript framework. With SvelteKit, I can create fast, efficient web apps 
                that are easy to maintain and update. It's just one more tool in my programming toolkit.<br><br>
        
                Overall, I'm a driven and passionate programmer with a wide range of interests and skills. I'm 
                always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. 
                If you're looking for a programmer who's always pushing the limits, then look no further than me, 
                Felix Zhao.
