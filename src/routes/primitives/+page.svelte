        Primitive Variables Printing check spelling of the print statement check
        number of double quotes, syntax error Variables and Data Types Primitive
        boolean - true/false int - 32 bit integers double - decimal numbers
        Non-primitive Strings - text defined with double quotes most
        non-primitive variables are made by the user Variable Names letters,
        digits or underscores may not start with a digit spaces are not allowed
        no java reserved words camelCase Constants use the word “final” before
        the data type and identifier constants should be UPPER_CASE with
        underscores Arithmetic Expressions ORDER OF OPERATIONS String literals
        are surrounded by double quotes, can only concatenate to them addition
        subtraction multiplication / division integer division removes decimal
        divide by 0 - ArithmeticException % modulus remainder mod has same order
        as * and / Assignment Operator = assigns the value on the right side to
        the variable on the left assignment is last in order of operations
        compound assignment operators += -= *= /= %= Increment and Decrement ++
        increment += 1 -- decrement = 1 Casting change the type of one variable
        to another from larger data type to smaller, loss of data (double) 1/6;
