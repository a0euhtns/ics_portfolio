            <P class="my-4">Amori is a short, story-centered game heavily inspired by the game Omori 
                made by Omocat. It was the final project for my grade 10 computer science
                culminating project. Me and my parter had a lot of fun using processing
                to its fullest capabilities to make a game that we both enjoyed at the end.<br><br>

            <P class="my-4">LearnAI.js is a javascript library I helped make for my grade 11 computer science
                final project. The AI was developed by us to help other students learn about AI, 
                and help teachers teach students about AI in a more fun and creative way. The base 
                AI was trained to detect hand-drawn numbers.<br><br>

            <P class="my-4">Inbot is a discord bot that I helped make for a Lyonhacks III, a hackathon event. 
                The purpose of Inbot is to help students stay on track and get regular notifications 
                of their emails all in discord. Personally, I can find it hard to check my emails regularly, 
                so having a bot send you your emails to a place you frequently visit helps with productivity.<br><br>

            <P class="my-4">Timber Trek is a game made for the ICS4U0 course. It is a game about surviving in the forest,
                which includes a lot of information about many different aspects about surviving in the forest. The purpose 
                of the game is to help young teenagers who might spend their summers at camp learn how to survive in the forest
                just in case they get lost. The game include many different aspects including lessons, mazes and action levels.<br><br>
